# pygame-asteroids
A tutorial for creating an asteroids game with Pygame (Python 3). 

To get to the solution you can checkout the solution branch. 

The solution is not comprehensive and simply just allows the player to move the ship from side to side and when the asteroid hits it resets the player back to their position.
